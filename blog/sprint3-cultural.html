    <h3> <em> "What is Emotional Intelligence?"</em> </h3>
    <p> Emotional Intelligence is about being aware of your actions and your feelings and how your actions and feelings affect those around you. <br> It's also about being mindful of how others are feeling and responding appropriately. </p>
    <h3> <em> "How is it different to IQ?"</em> </h3>
    <p> Emotional Intelligence differs from IQ in that it:
        <ol> <li> Assesses the emotions of a person, of others and of groups (while IQ assess the intelligence of an individual). </li>
            <li> It can be developed and improved whilst IQ cannot. </li>
            <li> Ensures success in life whilst IQ ensures success in school. </li>
            <li> Recognises leaders, captains, managers and people with social challenges while IQ recognises people with high intellect, common sense as well as mental challenges.</li>
            </ol> </p>
    <h3> <em> "Why is it important?"</em> </h3>
    <p> Emotional Intelligence is important as it can lead a person on a path towards a more happy and fulfilled life, support the advancement towards academic and professional success, improve relationships as well as boost communication skills. <br> Emotional Intelligence can also help a person better manage stress, form and develop meaningful human relationships, as well as improve their physical and psychological health. </p>
