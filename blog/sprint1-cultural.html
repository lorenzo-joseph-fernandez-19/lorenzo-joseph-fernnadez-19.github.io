        <h4>01 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3><em> "Explain a situation where you had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took?"</em></h3>
    <p>
    I was challenged ethically when I worked as an account manager at an Eftpos/Payments Company. <br> There was a time when a long time customer called through wanting to cancel their eftpos agreement as they were selling their business however as per company policy they had to either sign over their existing contract to the new owners or risk paying a cancellation fee for the remaining term. In this case the new owners had already signed a new contract with another supplier meaning that I had to charge the existing owners a cancellation fee. In my mind I was conflicted as from the company's perspective the customer had signed a legal agreement however from the customer's perspective this was unfair as they had been with my company for so many years and they had felt that they'd paid off more than the total cost of Eftpos machine. The consequences from this decision were verbal abuse from the customer, constant stress as the customer was always calling to follow up as well as a huge drop in my productivity as all my attention was focused on resolving this one situation.

    <h3> <em> "Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?"</em></h3>
    <p>
    Coming from so many cultures (I’m Malaysian Indian European Maori - I know right…) I feel like I don’t have one or attribute myself to one as in some way I feel that would limit who I click with culturally. Personally I feel that my Christian faith has influenced my identity and my values as I wouldn’t have a moral compass or reason to be considerate, honest and humble.

    <h3><em> "Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?"</em></h3>
    <p> I believe that my strengths in learning and career development are that I can quickly pick up information and I'm open to learning different things (prior to this I was studying a Diploma in Digital Marketing as well as completing a CELTA certificate). Adding on from this my limitations with both my learning and career development are that I tend to not ask for help and I haven't been satisfied and/or challenged in any of the jobs that I've worked in.  </p>
    <h3> <em>"Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles?"</em></h3>
    <p>I believe my ability to pick up information quickly would help in my learning journey here at Dev Academy however this may be hindered by my inability to ask for help.</p>
    <h3> <em> "Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?"</em></h3>
    <p>
    Before enrolling in Dev Academy I worked briefly as a Marketing Coordinator for the same payments company. Often there would be resistance and tension between myself and the sales department as they would often request me to do urgent work without clear instructions of what needed to be done. In these situations I would honestly delay doing the work or I would email them to explain exactly what needed to be done. Looking back now my first strategy wasn't effective at all as it showed that I wasn't really being a team player. Moving forward I think I would compile a checklist of questions I needed answered and send that checklist to the team if instructions were unclear or were not given. </p>
