    <div id="layer"><h1>My Learning Plan </h1> 
        <h4>01 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3> <em> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</em> </h3>
    <p> My long term goal is to be an Entrepreneur and run my own business. Part of my reason for taking up this course as well as others is so I'll be equipped to do this. In addition to this I see myself in working in the digital space either in development or marketing. </p>
    <h3> <em> What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</em> </h3>
    <p> Personally I would like to be able to improve my empathy and appreciation for others, my communication skills as well as my own growth mindset and conflict resolution skills.   </p>
    <h3> <em> A description of my own strengths and limitations:</em> </h3>
    <p> I believe my strengths are my ability to gel well with others, my creativity and my honesty. I also believe that my limitations are that I tend to not ask for help this probably because I'm quite introverted and feel that it would be a huge undertaking and a bit of a time waster to ask for help (that's probably my pride talking...) </p>
    <h3> <em> A commitment as to how I'll manage my workload in this programme:</em> </h3> 
    <p>For me the commitment would be around keeping to my scheduled study blocks as well as sticking to and allowing myself time to rest. It also means not beating myself up when I can't solve a problem right away as well as giving myself breaks in between study sessions and catching up on missed study sessions.</p>
    <h3><em>A commitment as to how I'll seek help in a timely way:</em></h3>
    <p> This is definitely a limitation for me however I aim to 
        <ol> <li> Use Google to look for forums and solutions to my problem(s). </li>
        <li> Message my facilitator on Slack.</li>
        <li> Message my peers on Slack. </li>
        <li> Post my questions/problems on the code-help-desk slack channel.</li>
        </ol> </p>
    <h3><em>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team:</em></h3>
    <p> My expectations from the facilitation team would be that they respond to my problems/questions in a timely manner if not point me in the right direction. (I understand that my facilitators are humans too...)</p>
    <h3> <em>Other commitments? </em></h3>
    <p> In terms of my other commitments I've planned to do these either before my morning study sessions or after them in the evenings. </p>
