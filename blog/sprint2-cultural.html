    <div id="layer"><h1>My Bootcamp Learning Plan </h1> 
    <h4>18 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3> <em> "What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?"</em> </h3>
    <p>
      To be an entrepreneur and run my own business and to be able to work from home if not remotely.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?"</em></h3>
    <p>
      I think my people skills would be one of my biggest strengths throughout Bootcamp as it would help me with pair programming as well as help me stay sane. Furthermore I believe my biggest limitations would be around not asking for help as well as not prioritising rest and breaks throughout Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</em></h3>
    <p>
      I feel that my biggest non-technical challenge would be staying focussed for 9 weeks as well as prioritising rest and breaks.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</em></h3>
    <p>
      During Bootcamp I would like to develop my self awareness and reflective skills as this is something that I want to do more of.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "What are you expectations from the Bootcamp team?"</em></h3>
    <p>
      Fundamentally I expect the Bootcamp team to be understanding and supportive especially when I'm struggling to follow or understand the learning material.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "What are your expectations of yourself at Bootcamp?"</em></h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
          <li> That i will stay on top of the learning material and put in more work if I feel like I'm falling behind.</li>
          <li> That I will not refrain from asking for help but will do so even when I feel like I have a rough idea of the answer.</li>
          <li> That I will use my time wisely and space out time for work and time for rest/breaks.</li>
          <li> That I won't beat myself up when I don't understand something.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h1> My Foundations Learning Plan </h1>
    <h4>01 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3> <em> "What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?"</em> </h3>
    <p> 
      My long term goal is to be an Entrepreneur and run my own business. Part of my reason for taking up this course as well as others is so I'll be equipped to do this. In addition to this I see myself in working in the digital space either in development or marketing. 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</em> </h3>
    <p> 
      Personally I would like to be able to improve my empathy and appreciation for others, my communication skills as well as my own growth mindset and conflict resolution skills.   
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "A description of my own strengths and limitations?"</em> </h3>
    <p> 
      I believe my strengths are my ability to gel well with others, my creativity and my honesty. I also believe that my limitations are that I tend to not ask for help this probably because I'm quite introverted and feel that it would be a huge undertaking and a bit of a time waster to ask for help (that's probably my pride talking...) 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "A commitment as to how I'll manage my workload in this programme?"</em> </h3> 
    <p>
      For me the commitment would be around keeping to my scheduled study blocks as well as sticking to and allowing myself time to rest. It also means not beating myself up when I can't solve a problem right away as well as giving myself breaks in between study sessions and catching up on missed study sessions.
    </p>
    <h3><em>"A commitment as to how I'll seek help in a timely way?"</em></h3>
    <p> This is definitely a limitation for me however I aim to...
      <ol><li> Use Google to look for forums and solutions to my problem(s). </li>
          <li> Message my facilitator on Slack.</li>
          <li> Message my peers on Slack. </li>
          <li> Post my questions/problems on the code-help-desk slack channel.</li>
      </ol> 
    </p>
    <h3><em>"A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?"</em></h3>
    <p> 
      My expectations from the facilitation team would be that they respond to my problems/questions in a timely manner if not point me in the right direction. (I understand that my facilitators are humans too...)<
    </p>
    <h3> <em>"Other commitments?"" </em></h3>
    <p> 
      In terms of my other commitments I've planned to do these either before my morning study sessions or after them in the evenings.
