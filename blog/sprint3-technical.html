    <h3> <em> "An analogy to describe the differences between HTML, CSS & Javascript?"</em> </h3>
    <p> HTML is much like the frame of house as it is all about providing structure and content to a webpage. CSS on the other hand can be likened to adding style to the house (i.e. paint, wallpaper, interior design) as itâ€™s concerned with how to make the webpage/house look good. Between the both of them web developers can create some pretty cool looking things however those things will be static and won't be able to react or adapt to what users will be doing on their websites. Much like adding electricity to a house, Javascript enables web developers to add interactivity to their documents and make their websites come alive. </p> 
    <h3> <em> "Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life?" </em> </h3>
    <p> From my understanding a control flow can be compared to a daily to do list where your flow statements represent tasks that need to be completed throughout the day i.e. eat breakfast, go to the gym, etc. A loop is basically taking the exact same to do list and repeating it the next day. </p>
    <h3> <em> "Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it?" </em> </h3>
    <p> The DOM (Document Object Model) defines a standard for accessing and updating the content, structure and style of a document and is made up of 3 different parts: the Core DOM, XML DOM and the HTML DOM. <br> By manipulating the DOM, web developers can create applications that update the data of the page without refreshing it. They can also create other applications that are customisable by the user. </p>
    <h3> <em> "Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?"</em> </h3>
    <p>Accessing data from an array is essentially like pulling data from a list with one variable containing different values (like a list of names) while accessing data from an object is like pulling properties (like shape, colour, size) from different variables. </p>
    <h3> <em> "Explain what functions are and why they are useful?" </em> </h3>
    <p> Functions put simply are programs inside of programs that are useful for storing reusable code and keeping things organised within a program as they help group variables together. </p>
