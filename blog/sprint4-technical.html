    <div id="layer"><h1> Problem Solving </h1> 
        <h4> 14 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3> <em> "A time I had got blocked on a simple problem?"</em> </h3>
    <p>
        During Sprint 4 I had spent alot of time stuck on question 6 of the Manipulating JS Objects Challenge to the point where I had decided to comment out the question in order to complete the rest of the challenge. Much to my own dismay it turns out that I had completely misread the question and had tried coming up with my own way of solving the solution not realising that all I had to do was set Terah's spouses spouse equal to Terah.  
    </p> 
    <h3> <em> "A time I had solved a problem in an elegant way?"</em> </h3>
    <p>
        During the same challenge (after I had commented out question 6) I felt that everything was coming together and I was able to get to a solution without having to Google or ask my peers/coaches for help. 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "How confident I felt using the problem solving techniques and process?"</em></h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
           <h3><li> Pseudocode </li></h3> 
                <p> 
                    I'm confident writing Pseudocode since it gives me a rough idea of where and how I could start writing my code.
                </p>
            <h3><li> Trying Something</li></h3>
                <p>
                    I feel confident using this technique and tend to do this alot before I ask my peers or coaches for help.
                </p>
            <h3><li> Rubber Ducky Method </li></h3>
                <p> 
                    I haven't yet tried this method but I think I would be confident using it but only as a last resort. 
                </p>
            <h3><li> Reading Error Messages </li></h3>
                <p>
                    Confident with this. Often I'll read through error messages first before doing anything else. 
                </p>
            <h3><li> Console Logging </li></h3>
                <p>
                    I'm confident using the console but to be honest I don't do this enough.
                </p>
            <h3><li> Googling</li></h3>
                <p>
                    I'm really confident turning to Google for help. Pretty much 85-90% of my problem solving strategy revolves around Googling for an answer(s).
                </p>
            <h3><li> Asking your peers for help</li></h3>
                <p>
                    I'm not that confident using this technique in fact I tend to avoid doing it unless it's absolutely necessary.
                </p>
            <h3><li> Asking coaches for help</li></h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to asking peers for help I tend to also avoid asking coaches for help unless I absolutely have to.
                </p>
            <h3><li> Improving your process with reflection </li></h3>
                <p> 
                    I haven't used this technique yet however I would be confident using it at the end of every difficult challenge.
                </p>
