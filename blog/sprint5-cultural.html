    <h3> <em> "Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?"</em> </h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity makes our brains extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in our brains. It refers to our brain’s ability to adapt. Neuroplasticity can also help people recover from brain events like strokes, traumatic brain injuries, rewired functions in the brain, enhance memory abilities, enhance cognitive abilities and can lead to more effective learning. </p> 
    <h3> <em> "Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?"</em> </h3>
    <p> <ol><li> Practicing mindfulness through regular exercise, yoga, etc.</li>
            <li> Engaging and challenging myself with new learning. </li>
            <li> Eating a well balanced diet. </li>
            <li> Spending more time outside in sunlight.</li>
            </ol> </p>
    <h3> <em> "What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?"</em> </h3>
    <p> <ol> <li> Practice, practice and more practice.</li>
             <li> Sleeping more as it encourages learning retention.</li>
             <li> Being more creative as this enhances the connectivity of the brain at rest.</li>
             <li> Travelling as it exposes the brain to novel stimuli and new environments.</li>
             <li> Dancing/Exercising as it reduces the risk of Alzheimers and increases neural connectivity. </li>
    </ol></p>

    <h3> <em> "Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant?"</em></h3>
    <p> Growth Mindset is a term used to describe the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. It’s relevant because it can help students increase their performance simply through them learning that they can get smarter (their intelligence and learning isn’t fixed) and that through effort they can get stronger. </p>
    <h3><em> "In this exploration, did anything suprise you? Change for you?</em></h3>
    <p>I found the whole learning from reflecting on experiences really interesting and intelligence being malleable interesting as well. I think I had always been told that practice makes perfect but found this quite cliche and mechanical which led me to procrastinating more. But through understanding that learning is essentially the formation of new or stronger neural connections this highlights why it is important to keep practicing. </p>
    <h3> <em> "How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?"</em></h3>
    <p> <ol> <li> By understanding that if I put in the effort I will reap the rewards. That success is a byproduct of effort. </li>
             <li> By learning from criticism and embracing challenges as ways to develop my abilities.</li>
    </ol></p>
