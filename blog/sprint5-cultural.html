        <h4> 18 December 2019 </h4>
    <h3> <em> "What are 3 new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?"</em> </h3>
    <p> <ol><li> That I'm hesitant to ask others for help.</li>
            <li> That I struggle to be mindful and often I'll find myself worrying about things that happened in the past or may happen in the future. </li>
            <li> That I don't give myself enough breaks and time to rest. </li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?"</em> </h3>
    <p> 
        In the context of both learning and programming values, empathy and self awareness helps each person (whether learner or developer) understand and hence manage their own emotions in order to improve the performance of their teams and themselves. 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "What has surprised you the most about the core learning?"</em></h3>
    <p>
        Core has taught me to be more responsible for my own learning and my own emotional intelligence. It's also helped me to understand my own motives behind enrolling in EDA. 
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?"</em></h3>
    <p> 
        I found practicing mindfulness to be pretty challenging as often I would delay doing it so I could hae more time working through the challenges. More often than not I would find myself less productive and more stressed as I wasn't able to stay focussed on the task.
    </p>
    <h3><em> "Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?"</em></h3>
    <p>
        I believe this is because a lot of the technical skills can be learnt whilst working in the industry but also as recruiters are looking for exceptional human beings (instead of exceptional soulless robots) who will add to the culture of their team.
    </p>
    <h3> <em> "Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer."</em></h3>
    <p>
        I don't think that Core has been a waste of time at all. To me it's balanced out the intensive technical learning and reminded me that there will always be a human element to programming. I think that offering core skills in Foundations and Human Skills in Bootcamp is what sets EDA apart from other institutions. The truth is these days anyone can learn how to code online however most employers wnat more than a technical whizz. They want a human being who will add to the culture of their teams.
